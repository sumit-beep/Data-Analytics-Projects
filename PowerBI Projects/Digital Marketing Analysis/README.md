# Problem Statement

The primary objective is to optimize the performance of advertising campaigns across various platforms to achieve maximum return on investment (ROI) for clients.

To accomplish this, we have access to multiple datasets containing features
related to ad campaigns, impressions, clicks, conversions, sales, and advertising
budgets.

## Analysis Objectives:

1. **Campaign Performance Analysis:** Evaluate the performance of each ad campaign by
analyzing metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and ROI across different
platforms and ad formats.

2. **Platform Comparison:** Compare the performance of advertising campaigns across
different platforms to identify the most effective platforms in terms of cost efficiency
and conversion rates.

3. **Optimization of Ad Formats:** Determine the effectiveness of different ad formats (e.g.,
display ads, skippable ads) and optimize their usage to maximize user engagement and
conversion rates.

4. **Budget Allocation Optimization:** Optimize the allocation of advertising budgets across
campaigns, platforms, and ad formats to achieve the highest possible ROI while
meeting sales targets.

## Types of Analysis:

1. **Temporal Analysis:** Identify temporal patterns and seasonality trends in ad performance
to optimize campaign scheduling and budget allocation throughout the year.

2. **User Engagement Analysis:** Analyze user engagement metrics such as average pages
visited and average time on site to understand the quality of traffic driven by advertising
campaigns and optimize targeting strategies accordingly.

3. **Cost Efficiency Analysis:** Evaluate the cost efficiency of advertising campaigns by
analyzing metrics such as CPM and CPC, identifying opportunities to reduce costs while
maintaining or improving campaign performance.

## Marketing Analysis Insight

- **Total conversions are significantly higher than total sales revenue.** This is likely because the average
conversion rate is higher than the average order value. In other words, more people are converting on
the ads than are making a purchase. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the ads being
effective at generating interest but not necessarily at driving sales, or the products or services being
sold being expensive or complex.

- **The cost per click (CPC) is lower than the cost per mille (CPM).** This means that it is cheaper to get
someone to click on an ad than it is to show them the ad 1,000 times. This is a good sign, as it means
that the ads are being targeted to the right people and that they are effective at generating clicks.

- **The conversion rate is highest for platform A.** This means that platform A is the most effective at
driving conversions. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the platform's targeting
capabilities, the creative of the ads, or the placement of the ads.

- **The bounce rate is highest in January and December.** This means that more people are leaving the
website without converting in these months. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the
seasonality of the business, the quality of the website, or the relevance of the ads.

- **The average time spent on website is highest for campaign 2.** This means that people are more
engaged with the content on campaign 2. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the quality
of the content, the relevance of the content to the target audience, or the length of the content.
